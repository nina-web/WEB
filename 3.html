<h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가</h2>>
<p>
JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6]
often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
 that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7]
  JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
  and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions
